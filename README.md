# Apple-Tree-Project
Final project for Algorithms &amp; Data Structures, Spring 2023

Instructions: in teams, write 2 different algorithms based on the provided Python data structures and specified criteria.

For the algorithm in this respository, we were provided with the Array Stack and Array Queue data structures so we could implement them in our code. The criteria given for this algorithm was to define classes for AppleTree, Basket, Wagon, Storage, and Worker, using the provided data structures. Then, define functions for each class to perform certain actions, and finally, write an algorithm that emulates the following apple-picking process:

Worker 1 picks an apple from AppleTree and places it in the Basket
  -> when the Basket is full, Worker 2 empties the Basket into Wagon
      -> once the Wagon is full, Worker 2 takes the Wagon to Storage and empties it
          -> repeat process until AppleTree is empty and Storage is full

My Responsibilities:
• Help write functions for classes
• Help plan out and write the algorithm
• Help debug the code
